            <p>GitHub is an online coding tool used to host open source projects. Many developers/groups of developers use GitHub everyday at work. By now, most of you have already got to know that Microsoft has acquired GitHub.</p>

            <p>I am a college student currently studying in 3rd year of ECE. I got my first computer at the age of 4 and since then, I got addicted to computers. My curiosity in learning something new about computers never ends! Currently, I am exploring Web Development and have recently got into blogging.</p>
