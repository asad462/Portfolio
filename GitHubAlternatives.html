    <div>GitHub is a code hosting tool for developers, which is widely used for version control. This tool allows developers to work on various projects together. For a long time, GitHub has been the preferred place for hosting open source projects.</div>
    <div>By now, most of us have been aware that Microsoft has acquired GitHub and with Microsoft entering the scene,a lot of open source projects have been moved to other GitHub alternatives.</div>

    <div>Hence, I have compiled a list of other alternatives to GitHub.</div>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h2>Google Cloud Source Repositories</h2>
            <div>This can be a good alternative for keeping private repositories. The users can get started with a limit of 5 users and 50 GB storage. They get a free trial for a period of 12 months.</div>

            <div>It is worth noting that the user won't be charged if he/she is using the Google Cloud Platform within the free usage limits.</div>
        </li>

    </ol>
